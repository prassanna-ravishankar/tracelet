# Overview
Tracelet is an intelligent, zero-configuration experiment tracking system designed specifically for PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning workflows. It automatically captures metrics, system information, and experiment metadata without requiring developers to modify their existing training code. The product solves the critical problem of experiment reproducibility and tracking in machine learning by providing seamless integration with popular experiment tracking backends like MLflow, Weights & Biases, and AIM.

The target users are ML engineers, researchers, and data scientists who want to focus on model development rather than experiment tracking infrastructure. Tracelet eliminates the friction of manually instrumenting code for experiment tracking while ensuring comprehensive capture of all relevant experiment data.

# Core Features
## Automatic Metric Capture
- What it does: Automatically intercepts and captures PyTorch TensorBoard logs, Lightning training metrics, and custom logging calls without code modification
- Why it's important: Eliminates the need for manual metric logging, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring no metrics are missed
- How it works: Uses runtime patching of framework logging methods to transparently capture all metric calls

## Multi-Backend Support
- What it does: Provides unified interface to multiple experiment tracking backends (MLflow, Weights & Biases, AIM) with automatic configuration
- Why it's important: Allows users to switch between tracking platforms without changing code, and supports different organizational preferences
- How it works: Abstract backend interface with specific implementations for each platform, configurable via environment variables

## System Metrics Monitoring
- What it does: Continuously monitors and logs CPU, GPU, memory usage, and other system metrics during training
- Why it's important: Critical for understanding resource utilization, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring reproducible environments
- How it works: Background thread collection with configurable intervals, GPU monitoring via NVML when available

## Git Integration
- What it does: Automatically captures Git repository state including branch, commit hash, uncommitted changes, and remote information
- Why it's important: Essential for experiment reproducibility and tracking which code version produced which results
- How it works: GitPython integration that captures repository metadata at experiment start

## Environment Tracking
- What it does: Records Python version, platform information, and environment variables relevant to the experiment
- Why it's important: Ensures experiments can be reproduced in the same environment conditions
- How it works: Platform and environment detection with configurable variable filtering

## Framework-Specific Integrations
- What it does: Deep integration with PyTorch Lightning and vanilla PyTorch training loops
- Why it's important: Captures framework-specific metrics and training state automatically
- How it works: Framework detection and method patching for Lightning trainers and PyTorch TensorBoard writers

# User Experience
## User Personas

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation First (Phase 1 Priority Order)
- Core experiment engine must be built first as all other components depend on it
- Configuration system needed before any integrations can be implemented
- Basic metric logging interface required before framework patching can begin
- MLflow backend provides immediate value and serves as reference implementation
- Git integration provides essential reproducibility from day one
- System metrics collection can be developed in parallel with core engine

## Getting to Usable Frontend Quickly
- Start with simple Python API (`start_logging()`, `stop_logging()`) for immediate usability
- Focus on PyTorch TensorBoard integration as it provides visible metric capture
- Implement basic MLflow backend to show results in familiar interface
- Add artifact logging early so users can save and retrieve model checkpoints
- Ensure error handling and graceful degradation for missing dependencies

## Framework Integration (Phase 2 Dependencies)
- PyTorch integration must be stable before Lightning integration
- Lightning integration depends on understanding PyTorch patterns
- System metrics GPU monitoring requires stable base metrics collection
- Advanced TensorBoard features build on basic scalar logging

## Multi-Backend Testing & Validation (Phase 3 Dependencies)
- MLflow backend implementation must be stable and working before expanding to other backends
- ClearML and W&B implementations can be developed in parallel once core patterns are established
- Docker Compose setup for MLflow enables consistent local development environment
- End-to-end testing requires stable core experiment engine and framework integrations
- Backend comparison testing validates that abstraction layer works across different platforms

## Backend Expansion (Phase 4 Dependencies)
- Phase 3 testing validates that backend abstraction layer is robust and extensible
- AIM backend implementation follows patterns proven with MLflow, ClearML, and W&B
- Multi-backend support requires all individual backends to be complete and tested
- Backend migration tools need deep understanding of each platform's data model from Phase 3 testing

## Advanced Features (Phase 5 Dependencies)
- Custom collector framework requires stable core interfaces and proven patterns
- Real-time features depend on efficient data flow established in earlier phases
- Web dashboard requires complete data model and API from previous phases
- ML library integrations follow same patterns as PyTorch/Lightning

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- Risk: Runtime patching of framework methods may break with framework updates
- Mitigation: Comprehensive testing matrix with multiple framework versions, graceful fallback when patching fails, version-specific patches

- Risk: Performance overhead from continuous system metrics collection and method patching
- Mitigation: Configurable collection intervals, efficient data structures, background threading, performance benchmarking

- Risk: Backend API changes breaking integrations
- Mitigation: Version-specific backend adapters, comprehensive error handling, dependency version pinning, abstract interface design

## Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
- Risk: Over-engineering the abstraction layers in early phases
- Mitigation: Start with concrete MLflow implementation, extract abstractions only when adding second backend

- Risk: Feature creep leading to complex, hard-to-maintain MVP
- Mitigation: Strict MVP definition focusing on core PyTorch + MLflow integration, defer advanced features

- Risk: Framework integration complexity making system fragile
- Mitigation: Extensive testing, optional integration features, graceful degradation when patching fails

## Resource Constraints
- Risk: Limited testing resources for multiple framework and Python version combinations
- Mitigation: Focus on most popular combinations first (PyTorch 1.x, Python 3.9+), community-driven testing

- Risk: Backend integration complexity consuming too much development time
- Mitigation: Start with MLflow (simpler API), leverage existing client libraries, phase backend additions

- Risk: Documentation and examples keeping pace with rapid feature development
- Mitigation: Documentation-driven development, automated example testing, community contributions

# Appendix
## Research Findings
- Current experiment tracking solutions (MLflow, W&B) require significant code modification and manual instrumentation
- PyTorch Lightning users frequently struggle with metric logging consistency across different training setups
- System metrics (GPU, CPU, memory) are frequently overlooked but critical for understanding training performance and reproducibility
