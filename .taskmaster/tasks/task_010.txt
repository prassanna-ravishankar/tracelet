# Task ID: 10
# Title: ClearML Backend Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement ClearML backend with free SaaS platform integration
# Details:
Create ClearML backend adapter following the patterns established with MLflow. Test integration with the free ClearML SaaS platform at clearml.allegro.ai.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with ClearML SaaS platform, feature parity tests with MLflow backend

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up ClearML SDK and authentication [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install ClearML SDK, configure authentication credentials for the free SaaS platform, and establish connection to clearml.allegro.ai
### Details:
Install clearml package via pip, create API credentials on clearml.allegro.ai free tier account, configure clearml.conf with access credentials, and verify connection to the SaaS platform. Test basic SDK operations like listing projects and experiments.

## 2. Create ClearML backend adapter class [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement the ClearML backend adapter following the abstract interface pattern established by MLflow backend
### Details:
Create ClearMLBackend class inheriting from the abstract backend interface, implement all required methods for experiment creation, metric logging, artifact storage, and parameter tracking. Map ClearML concepts (Task, Project) to the abstract interface. Handle ClearML-specific features like automatic logging and model registry.

## 3. Implement experiment tracking and logging [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop full CRUD operations for experiments, metrics, parameters, and artifacts using ClearML Tasks API
### Details:
Implement create_experiment, log_metrics, log_parameters, log_artifacts methods using ClearML Task API. Handle ClearML's automatic logging features, task status management, and scalar/plot logging. Ensure proper mapping between abstract interface concepts and ClearML's Task/Project structure.

## 4. Add ClearML-specific features and configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement ClearML-specific features like automatic framework logging, model registry integration, and configuration management
### Details:
Add support for ClearML's automatic logging of frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), integrate with ClearML's model registry for artifact versioning, implement configuration options for output_uri, auto_connect features, and task types. Create configuration schema for ClearML-specific settings.

## 5. Create documentation and example notebooks [done]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Write comprehensive documentation and create example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating ClearML backend usage
### Details:
Create README documentation for ClearML backend setup and usage, write API documentation for all ClearML-specific features, develop example notebooks showing experiment tracking workflows, comparison with MLflow backend, and ClearML-specific features like automatic logging and model registry. Include troubleshooting guide for common SaaS platform issues.
