# Task ID: 3
# Title: PyTorch TensorBoard Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add PyTorch TensorBoard patching for seamless metric capture
# Details:
Implement runtime patching of PyTorch TensorBoard logging methods to automatically capture metrics without code modification. This should intercept TensorBoard writer calls and route them through the experiment tracking system.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for patching logic, integration tests with sample PyTorch training scripts
