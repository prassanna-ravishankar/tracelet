# Task ID: 12
# Title: End-to-End Integration Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive end-to-end tests for all backends with sample PyTorch workflows
# Details:
Develop end-to-end integration tests covering all three backends (MLflow, ClearML, W&B) with realistic PyTorch training workflows. This validates the complete system works as intended.

# Test Strategy:
Automated testing pipeline with Docker containers, performance benchmarking across backends

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design E2E Test Framework Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the base framework for end-to-end integration testing with support for multiple backends
### Details:
Create a flexible test framework that can initialize and teardown test environments for MLflow, ClearML, and W&B. Include utilities for Docker container management, test data generation, and result validation. The framework should support parallel test execution and provide clear separation between backend-specific and common test logic.

## 2. Create PyTorch Training Workflow Templates [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop realistic PyTorch training workflows that exercise all tracking features across different scenarios
### Details:
Implement multiple training scenarios including: simple CNN training, PyTorch Lightning workflows, distributed training simulation, hyperparameter tuning workflows, and model checkpointing scenarios. Each template should exercise metrics logging, artifact storage, parameter tracking, and visualization features.

## 3. Implement Backend-Specific E2E Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create comprehensive end-to-end test suites for each backend (MLflow, ClearML, W&B) with Docker environments
### Details:
Develop isolated test suites for each backend that spin up the necessary infrastructure (MLflow server, ClearML server, W&B local instance) using Docker Compose. Tests should cover: experiment creation/deletion, metric logging at scale, artifact upload/download, parameter tracking, Git integration verification, and TensorBoard export validation.

## 4. Performance Benchmarking Suite [done]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Implement performance benchmarking tests to compare backend efficiency and identify bottlenecks
### Details:
Create benchmarking suite that measures: metric logging throughput, artifact upload/download speeds, memory usage during tracking, API response times, and scalability limits. Generate comparative reports showing performance characteristics of each backend under various load conditions.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Integrate E2E tests into CI/CD pipeline with automated test execution and reporting
### Details:
Set up GitHub Actions workflows that run E2E tests on multiple Python versions and OS combinations. Include test result aggregation, performance trend tracking, failure notifications, and automated test report generation. Implement test parallelization strategies and caching mechanisms to optimize CI runtime.
