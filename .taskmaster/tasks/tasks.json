Completed comprehensive mkdocs.yml configuration with proper navigation structure. Successfully created and validated critical documentation files including index.md with logo integration, installation.md, quick-start.md, configuration.md, and backend documentation (backends/index.md, backends/aim.md). Resolved major documentation drift issues in AIM backend by cross-referencing actual codebase implementation, corrected configuration mechanisms, updated accurate port numbers (43800 for UI, 53800 for API), removed unsupported feature examples, and added proper limitation warnings. MkDocs build pipeline now functional with only expected warnings for remaining missing navigation files.

Conducted thorough analysis of actual backend implementations to eliminate documentation drift and ensure accuracy. Updated README.md to reflect true codebase capabilities including corrected base dependencies (PyTorch/W&B are required), fixed environment variable names, updated configuration field names (track_system vs track_system_metrics), and clarified multi-backend support limitations.
