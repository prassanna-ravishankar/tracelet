# Task ID: 9
# Title: GPU Monitoring Enhancement
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add GPU monitoring via NVML to system metrics collection
# Details:
Extend system metrics to include GPU monitoring using NVML when available. This provides critical information for GPU-intensive training workloads.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mock NVML, integration tests on systems with NVIDIA GPUs
