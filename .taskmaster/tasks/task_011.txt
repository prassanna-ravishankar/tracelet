# Task ID: 11
# Title: Weights & Biases Backend Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Weights & Biases backend with free tier testing
# Details:
Create W&B backend adapter with comprehensive integration testing using the free tier. Ensure all W&B features are properly mapped to the abstract interface.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with W&B free tier, validation flows for all W&B features

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up W&B development environment and authentication [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure local development environment with Weights & Biases SDK, create free tier account, and implement authentication mechanism for the backend adapter
### Details:
Install wandb Python package, create W&B account credentials configuration, implement secure credential storage and retrieval mechanism compatible with the abstract backend interface. Set up project structure following the established patterns from MLflow and ClearML implementations.

## 2. Implement core W&B backend adapter class [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create the main WandbBackend class implementing the abstract backend interface with experiment lifecycle management
### Details:
Implement WandbBackend class inheriting from the abstract base, map W&B runs to experiment abstraction, handle project/entity management, implement experiment creation, initialization, and finalization methods. Ensure compatibility with W&B's run-based model while maintaining interface consistency.

## 3. Implement metrics and parameters logging [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Add support for logging metrics, parameters, and hyperparameters to W&B runs with proper data type handling
### Details:
Implement log_metric, log_metrics, log_param, log_params methods with W&B's wandb.log() and wandb.config APIs. Handle step-based metrics, custom x-axis support, and ensure proper data type conversions. Map W&B's flexible logging system to the standardized interface.

## 4. Implement artifact and model management [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Add support for W&B artifacts API including model versioning, dataset tracking, and general file artifacts
### Details:
Implement log_artifact, log_model methods using W&B's artifact API. Support artifact versioning, lineage tracking, and metadata association. Handle large file uploads efficiently within free tier constraints. Map W&B's artifact types to the abstract interface's artifact model.

## 5. Add search and visualization features [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Implement experiment search, comparison, and basic visualization capabilities using W&B's API
### Details:
Implement search_experiments, compare_experiments methods using W&B's GraphQL API. Add support for querying runs by tags, metrics, and parameters. Implement basic visualization helpers for metrics comparison. Ensure all features work within free tier API rate limits.
