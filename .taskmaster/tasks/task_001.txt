# Task ID: 1
# Title: Core Experiment Engine Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core experiment engine with basic metric logging capabilities
# Details:
Implement the central orchestrator managing experiment lifecycle and data flow. This includes the core Experiment class, ExperimentConfig for configuration, and basic metric logging interface. Focus on creating a solid foundation that all other components will depend on.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for core classes, integration tests for basic metric logging functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Experiment Class Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the base Experiment class with lifecycle management
### Details:
Create the core Experiment class that manages the complete experiment lifecycle including initialization, execution, cleanup, and state management. Define abstract interfaces for metric logging, configuration handling, and lifecycle hooks. Include context manager support for automatic resource cleanup.

## 2. Implement ExperimentConfig System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a flexible configuration system for experiment parameters
### Details:
Design ExperimentConfig class supporting hierarchical configuration with validation, serialization, and environment variable overrides. Include support for nested configurations, type validation, and default values. Implement configuration merging for inheritance and override patterns.

## 3. Create Metric Logging Interface [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop the abstract metric logging interface and basic implementations
### Details:
Define MetricLogger abstract base class with methods for logging scalars, histograms, images, and text. Create in-memory and file-based implementations for testing. Design buffering and batching mechanisms for efficient metric collection. Include timestamp management and metric namespacing.

## 4. Build Data Flow Orchestration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Implement the central orchestrator for managing data flow between components
### Details:
Create DataFlowOrchestrator that coordinates metric collection from various sources, manages buffering and routing to backends. Implement observer pattern for metric sources, thread-safe queue management, and configurable routing rules. Include backpressure handling and error recovery.

**COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**

Successfully implemented DataFlowOrchestrator with full feature set including thread-safe queue architecture, observer pattern for sources/sinks, flexible routing with pattern matching, backpressure handling, error recovery, and batch emit capabilities. Created comprehensive test suite and integrated with Experiment class as MetricSource.

**Files implemented:**
- tracelet/core/orchestrator.py (main implementation)
- tests/unit/core/test_orchestrator.py (test suite)
- Updated tracelet/core/experiment.py (orchestrator integration)

All core requirements met: thread-safe operations, configurable worker threads, robust error handling, and complete test coverage.

## 5. Develop Plugin System Foundation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Create the plugin architecture for extensible backend and source integrations
### Details:
Design plugin system supporting dynamic loading of metric sources and backends. Implement plugin discovery, validation, and lifecycle management. Create base classes for backend and source plugins with standardized interfaces. Include plugin configuration integration and dependency resolution.
<info added on 2025-07-20T20:58:47.816Z>
**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**

Comprehensive plugin system successfully implemented with full dynamic discovery, validation, and lifecycle management. Architecture includes four plugin types (BackendPlugin, CollectorPlugin, FrameworkPlugin, ProcessorPlugin) with MetricSink integration for orchestrator compatibility. Features include dependency resolution with topological sorting, configuration integration via JSON files, plugin metadata system with versioning, and robust error handling. Core files implemented: tracelet/core/plugins.py (main implementation), tests/unit/core/test_plugins.py (test suite), plus updates to experiment.py and __init__.py for integration. Plugin system is fully operational and integrated with the experiment class and orchestrator, enabling extensible backend and collector functionality as designed.
